# Why the ISS path is not a single thick line?
Although the ISS follows a nearly fixed orbital plane in space, the Earth rotates beneath it. As a result, each orbit passes over a different longitude, causing the ground track to shift westward every revolution. Over multiple days, this produces a woven or net-like pattern rather than a single thick line. Minor orbital precession due to Earth’s oblateness further prevents exact retracing of the same path.
